# # Snapshot checkpoint (non-persistent)
# The checkpoint method described in [Writing function checkpoints](./writing_functions_checkpoint)
# are *N-to-M*, meaning that you can write them out on N-processes and read them in on M processes.
#
# As discussed in that chapter, these checkpoints need to be associated with a mesh.
# This is because the function is defined on a specific function space, which in turn is
# defined on a specific mesh.
#
# However, there are certain scenarios where you simply want to store a checkpoint associated
# with the current mesh, that should only be possible to use during this simulation.
# An example use-case is when running an iterative solver, and wanting a fall-back mechanism that
# does not require extra RAM.

# In this example, we will demonstrate how to write a snapshot checkpoint to disk.

# First we define a function `f` that we want to represent in the function space
