# # Time-dependent mesh checkpoints
# As we have seen in the previous examples, we store information about the connectivity,
# the coordinates of the mesh nodes,
# as well as a reference element. Note that the only thing that can change for a mesh
# during a simulation are the coordinate of the mesh nodes.
# In the following example, we will demonstrate how to write a time-dependent mesh
# checkpoint to disk.

# First, we create a simple function to compute the volume of a mesh
